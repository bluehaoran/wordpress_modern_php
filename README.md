# wordpress_modern_php
Code demo for Sydney PHP Meetup talk: **Wordpress and Modern PHP, or how I made my peace with the most popular PHP application in the world**.

This demos the following technologies:
* Bedrock
* Composer
* WP-CLI
* Some sort of Dev Environment: Docker/Vagrant/etc



Things still to add:
* all of the above
* either [official Wordpress docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/)
* OR some docker-compose for Bedrock.
* plugin in separate repo, linked by composer.
